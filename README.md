## The Restart program is designed to take you from a beginner to a confident, job-ready professional in tech. Throughout the program, I gained knowledge in:
 - **Cloud Computing** – Learning AWS services, application deployment, and infrastructure management.
 - **Programming & Scripting** – Developing logic with Python, automating tasks, and working with data.
 - **Databases & Storage** – Designing, creating, and querying both relational and NoSQL databases.
 - **Networking & Security** – Understanding networking basics, VPNs, subnets, and security best practices.
 - **Professional Skills** – Working with Git, GitHub, documentation, collaboration, and problem-solving.
   
The Restart program not only teaches how to use tools but also emphasizes why they are important in real-world IT environments. It focuses on hands-on practice, building projects, and documenting progress to help you showcase your skills to potential employers.
