## Overview of Databases 

Databases are critical for storing, managing, and retrieving data in cloud applications. AWS offers a variety of managed database services to support both structured and unstructured data, which I explored through practical labs and projects.

-**Types of Database Services**

Amazon RDS
Amazon DynamoDB
Amazon Aurora

## Operational model

-**Amazon RDS**
A managed relational database service supporting engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, and Oracle for structured data. Ideal for traditional applications requiring structured data, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems or e-commerce platforms with tables and relationships.

-**Amazon DynamoDB**
 A fully managed NoSQL database designed for key-value and document data, offering high scalability and low latency.
Suited for high-throughput applications like gaming, IoT, or mobile apps that need fast, flexible data access.

-**Amazon Aurora**
 A high-performance, fully managed relational database compatible with MySQL and PostgreSQL, optimized for scalability and reliability.
Perfect for enterprise applications demanding high performance, scalability, and reliability, such as large-scale web applications.

-**Reflection on Database Learning**
Working with AWS database services clarified the differences between relational and NoSQL databases. I learned to select the appropriate service based on application needs: RDS for structured data with complex queries, DynamoDB for flexible, high-speed data access, and Aurora for high-performance, scalable workloads.
