## Overview of AWS Storage
Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers scalable, durable, and flexible storage solutions for cloud data management. Through hands-on labs, I explored various storage types—object, block, and file—and their applications in different scenarios.

- **Types of Storage Services**
Amazon S3 – Simple Storage Service
Amazon EBS– Elastic Block Store
Amazon EFS– Elastic File System


- **Amazon S3**
Object-based storage for storing and retrieving any type of data, such as images, backups, or application files, with high durability and scalability.Hosting static websites, storing backups, or managing large datasets for analytics, such as log files or media archives.


- **Amazon EBS** 
Block-level storage designed for EC2 instances, providing persistent storage for operating systems and application data. Providing consistent, low-latency storage for applications or databases running on EC2 instances, such as a MySQL database disk.


- **Amazon EFS** 
A scalable network file system that enables multiple EC2 instances to share access to files, ideal for collaborative environments. Enabling shared file access across multiple EC2 instances, such as for content management systems or development environments.

- **Reflection on Storage Learning**
Through my exploration of Amazon S3, EBS, and EFS, I gained a clear understanding of the differences between object, block, and file storage. I learned how to choose the right storage service based on the specific needs of an application: S3 is ideal for scalable and durable object storage, EBS provides high-performance block storage, and EFS allows for shared file access across multiple instances.
