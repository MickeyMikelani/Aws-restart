# Overview of AWS Security

Security is a vital aspect of cloud computing, safeguarding data, applications, and infrastructure. AWS offers strong security services to manage access, encrypt data, and defend against threats, which I investigated through practical labs and projects.

## Core Security Services

AWS IAM– Identity and Access Management
AWS KMS– Key Management Service 
AWS WAF & Shield–Web Application Firewall and AWS Shield 

- **AWS IAM** 
Manages user access and permissions to AWS resources, enabling fine-grained control over who can perform specific actions. Implementing least privilege access by creating user roles and policies for secure resource management, such as restricting access to specific S3 buckets.


- **AWS KMS** 
Provides encryption and key management to securely protect sensitive data across AWS services.Encrypting data stored in services like S3 or RDS to meet compliance and security requirements.


- **AWS WAF & Shield**
Protects applications from cyberattacks, such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and DDoS threats.Safeguarding websites and APIs from malicious traffic, such as protecting an e-commerce platform from DDoS attacks.


# Reflection on Security Learning
Learning about AWS security services highlighted the shared responsibility model, which states that AWS is responsible for securing the cloud infrastructure, while I am responsible for managing data and access controls. My experience with IAM (Identity and Access Management) and KMS (Key Management Service) has increased my confidence in designing secure cloud environments that effectively protect sensitive information.
