# Overview of AWS Networking

Networking services in AWS enable secure, scalable, and efficient communication between cloud resources and end users. Through hands-on labs, I learned how to design and manage network architectures that ensure performance, availability, and security.

- **Key Networking Services**
Amazon VPC– Virtual Private Cloud
Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)– Elastic Load Balancing
Route 53- Amazon Route 53


- **Amazon VPC** 
Creates a private, isolated network in AWS to securely host applications and resources.Building secure environments for web applications, databases, or internal systems by isolating resources within subnets.


- **Elastic Load Balancer (ELB)** 
Distributes incoming traffic across multiple instances to ensure high availability and performance. Ensuring applications remain available and responsive during traffic spikes, such as for e-commerce platforms during sales events.


- **Route 53**
A scalable DNS service that routes users to AWS resources or external endpoints via domain name resolution.Managing domain names and directing users to hosted services, such as mapping a domain to an EC2-hosted website.




# Reflection on Networking Learning
Exploring AWS networking services deepened my understanding of how cloud resources communicate securely and efficiently. I learned to design architectures that balance performance and security, using VPCs to isolate resources and ELBs to optimize traffic distribution.
