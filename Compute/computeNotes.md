## Overview of Compute Services

Compute services are essential for running applications in the cloud, providing a variety of options from fully managed serverless environments to customizable virtual servers. AWS offers flexible compute services designed to meet different needs, which I explored through hands-on labs and projects.

-**Types of Compute Services**
Amazon EC2
AWS Lambda
Elastic Beanstalk
ECS & EKS

## Operational model

- **Amazon EC2**
 Provides virtual servers (instances) for running applications with full control over the server environment.
Ideal for hosting websites or applications requiring full control over the server environment, such as custom web servers or databases.

- **AWS Lambda**
 A serverless compute service that runs code in response to events, eliminating the need to manage servers.
Perfect for automating tasks like image resizing, sending notifications, or processing data triggered by events.

- **Elastic Beanstalk**
Automatically handles application deployment, scaling, and monitoring, simplifying infrastructure management.
Simplifies deploying web applications quickly without managing underlying infrastructure.

- **ECS & EKS**
Services for running and managing containerized applications using Docker (ECS) or Kubernetes (EKS).
Enables scalable microservices architectures by running Docker containers for complex, distributed applications.

-**Reflection on Compute Learning**
My learning about AWS compute services, I noticed the flexibility that cloud computing offers. I gained insights into when to choose EC2 for granular control, Lambda for serverless efficiency, or Elastic Beanstalk for rapid deployment. Additionally, exploring ECS and EKS deepened my understanding of containerized applications, preparing me to design scalable and efficient solutions.
